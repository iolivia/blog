Welcome to the first Jekyll Uno Plus blog post! 

This is a new template forked from [Jekyll Uno](https://github.com/joshgerdes/jekyll-uno) with some small improvements!

Features of One Plus include:
* Social media links (configurable though `_config.yml`)
* Rich blogging capabilties

If you're new to Jekyll, you should also check out [Getting started with Jekyll](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-jekyll-plus-a-free-bootstrap-3-starter-theme).
