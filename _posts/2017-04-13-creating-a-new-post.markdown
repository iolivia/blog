I'll now show you how to create a new blog post in the Uno Plus template.

All you have to do is add a new file into `_posts`. Make sure it follows the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.markdown` and once you've rebuilt it should appear in the blog page automagically.

You'll need to give every post:
* a title
* a date
* list of categories (could be empty)
* list of tags (could be empty)

You can see tags [here](/jekyll-uno-plus/tags) and categories [here](/jekyll-uno-plus/categories).
